## fix(wizard): move modifier to body [(#2924)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2924)
* Moves `pf-m-no-padding` from `.pf-c-wizard__main` to `.pf-c-wizard__main-body` . The same styling will occur to the wizard main body. If you want to remove padding in the wizard main body you should add `pf-m-no-padding` to `.pf-c-wizard__main-body` now.

## fix(datalist): remove flex wrap for action button [(#2923)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2923)
* Removes `--pf-c-data-list__item-action--not-last-child--MarginBottom` all instances of it should be removed from your application.

* Removes `flex-wrap: wrap` from the data list actions. When the list of buttons get too long you should use the overflow menu to hide buttons, instead of flex-wrap, as we don't support this anymore.

## fix(tabs): Update class name for tabs button to be tabs link [(#2919)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2919)
* Renames the class `pf-c-tabs__button` to be `pf-c-tabs__link`. Any instances of the old class should be updated to the new class.

* Updates any tabs CSS variable with a reference to the BEM element `__button` to `__link`. Any references to tabs variables with `__button` should be replaced with `__link`.
E.g. `--pf-c-tabs--m-box__button--BackgroundColor` becomes `--pf-c-tabs--m-box__link--BackgroundColor`

## fix(radio): fixed issue where radio is cut off when comes after label [(#2912)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2912)
Adds a `1px` right margin to a radio component's input element when it comes after the label. This is a visual change only and no further updates are needed to consume this change.

## feat(colors): added new cyan, gold, green, red colors, updated blue [(#2906)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2906)
Updates `$pf-color-blue-50`/`--pf-global--palette--blue-50` from `#def3ff` to `#e7f1fa`. This is a visual change only, no further updates are needed to consume this change.

## fix(app launcher): applied external link icon class to icon wrapper [(#2904)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2904)
Moves the class `.pf-c-app-launcher__menu-item-external-icon` from the external link icon itself to a `<span>` that wraps the external link icon. Any instances of the external link icon should be wrapped in a `<span>` and the `.pf-c-app-launcher__menu-item-external-icon` class should be moved from the icon to the `<span>`.

## fix(drawer): removed m-border, enabled m-no-border on inline/static [(#2887)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2887)
* This PR removes the `.pf-m-border` variation as when the panel overlays content, a shadow should always be used instead of a border. And when the panel is inline with content (`pf-m-inline`, `pf-m-static`), a border should always be used instead of a shadow. Any reference to the `.pf-m-border` modifier class should be removed. 
* Enables `.pf-m-no-border` on inline and static variations, to remove the border if necessary. No updates are needed to consume this change as it is an added feature, but it's worth noting that the `.pf-m-no-border` class could have been used on inline and static drawer panels before, and would have simply done nothing. That class on the panels will now remove the border.

## fix(data-list): changed expanded content shadow to a border [(#2885)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2885)
* Replaces the box shadow on the expandable content element with a bottom border. This is a visual breaking change only and no further code changes are needed to consume this change.
* Removes `--pf-c-data-list__expandable-content--BoxShadow`,  `--pf-c-data-list__item--before--Height`, and `--pf-c-data-list__item-item--before--Height`. Any instances of these variables in your application should be removed as they are no longer used.
* Replaces `--pf-c-data-list__item--m-expanded__expandable-content--BorderTopWidth` with `--pf-c-data-list__expandable-content--BorderTopWidth`. Any instances of the old variable should be updated to the new variable.

## style(vertical-nav): refactored css structure [(#2884)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2884)
The nav component's css was refactored, see the file list for details on what changed 
https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2884/files

This PR:
1. Applies stylistic updates to css variables rather than redefining component elements.
2. Updates `--pf-c-nav__c-nested-component--Property` to `--pf-c-nav--c-nested-component--Property`. Any instances of the old variable should be updated to the new variable.
3. Updates visual style of navigation only, no HTML updates are necessary.

## fix(page): updated page and page header background colors [(#2883)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2883)
* Changes `--pf-c-page--BackgroundColor` from `--pf-global--BackgroundColor--dark-100` to `--pf-global--BackgroundColor--light-300`. This is just a visual change, no code updates are needed to consume it.
* Adds a background-color of `--pf-global--BackgroundColor--dark-100` to `.pf-c-page__header`. This is just a visual change, no code updates are needed to consume it.

## fix(modal): left aligned footer actions, removed pf-m-align-left [(#2881)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2881)
* Buttons in the modal footer are now left-aligned by default. No further updates are needed to consume this change.
* `.pf-m-align-left` has been removed as it is no longer needed. It can be removed from any modal footer elements it is currently applied to.
* Removed `--pf-c-modal-box__footer__c-button--first-of-type--MarginLeft`. Any reference to it should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly.

## feat(base): made shield styles optional by default (#2769) [(#2872)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2872)
The "shield" styles were intended to help resolve styling issues when using PF3 and PF4 together, but shouldn't be necessary for most PF users and is causing issues (https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/2276 as an example) as PatternFly evolves. 

This PR removes the global styles provided by https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/_shield-inheritable.scss and https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/_shield-noninheritable.scss, and makes them optional for applications to include.

If an application is importing its own SCSS, and needs to include these shield styles, `$pf-global--enable-shield` can be set to `true`, which enables the shield SCSS to be built in [_base.scss](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/_base.scss) or [patternfly.scss](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/patternfly.scss) (which imports `_base.scss`).
https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/14ab259521d3838f8a8e19411c41610f9d8783b4/src/patternfly/_base.scss#L10-L13


Applications can also import either the SCSS or compiled CSS via https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/patternfly-shield-inheritable.scss (which is compiled to `patternfly-shield-inheritable.css`) and https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/patternfly-shield-noninheritable.scss (which is compiled to `patternfly-shield-noninheritable.css`)

The contents of [_shield-inheritable.scss](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/_shield-inheritable.scss) and [_shield-noninheritable.scss](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/_shield-noninheritable.scss) are now SCSS mixins called `shield-inheritable` and `shield-noninheritable`, which allow us to include the blocks of code in SCSS conditionals.

This PR sets new styles on buttons necessary with the removal of `background-color: transparent` from all elements that the shield styles provided previously. No further updates should be needed to consume these style updates, and the visuals should remain exactly the same as they were before. The location of the styles just changed from the shield to the button component. 

* Link and Plain buttons now define `background-color: transparent` by default and on hover, focus, and active states.
* The control button now sets a white background and default text color for its normal, hover, focus, and active states.

As part of these button updates, the `:active` CSS selectors in the button component's stylesheet were moved after `:focus`, so that if the `:focus` and `:active` pseudo selectors declare styles on the same CSS properties for an element, the `:active` styles will now be visible when the element is `:active`. No changes are needed to consume this change, however any `:active` styles that may have been overridden by the `:focus` styles coming later in the stylesheet may now be visible.

## fix(sass-utilities): made bs-variables optional include [(#2871)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2871)
Removes `sass-utilities/bs-variables.scss` from `sass-utilities/_all.scss`, so it is no longer part of building the standard patternfly CSS. If you still need to import this file, you can import it manually.

## fix(table-td-wrapping): added to overflow-wrap [(#2868)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2868)
* This change addresses aggressive table cell text wrapping. Changes `td { word-break: break-word; }` to `tr > * { overflow-wrap: break-word; }`. No changes are necessary to consume this update.

## fix(empty-state): center content, fix vars, adjust secondary margin [(#2866)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2866)
* Introduces a new element `.pf-c-empty-state__content` that wraps the contents of the empty state content. The `max-width` used for the size variations applies to `.pf-c-empty-state__content` instead of `.pf-c-empty-state`, and `.pf-c-empty-state__content` is centered horizontally and vertically in its parent, reducing the need for using a `.pf-l-bullseye` layout to center empty state content. The bullseye layout can be removed from the empty state if it is being used to center the empty state horizontally, though there is likely no harm in leaving it.
  * Adds `--pf-c-empty-state__content--MaxWidth` that is overridden with `.pf-m-sm` and `.pf-m-lg` via `--pf-c-empty-state--m-sm__content--MaxWidth` and `--pf-c-empty-state--m-lg__content--MaxWidth`
  * Adds a `.pf-m-full-height` variation to `.pf-c-empty-state` for use when the empty state component should be centered vertically in a container, and the empty state does not already consume the height of its container.
* Adjusts the left/right spacing on buttons in the secondary actions container so that instead of using a `margin-right` to space the buttons, we use a `margin-left` and `margin-right`, which allows us to get rid of the negative right margin on the secondary actions container. All direct children of the secondary actions container are now styled instead of just `.pf-c-button` elements.
  * Removes `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--MarginRight`. This was just to offset the right margin on buttons in the `__secondary` container and is no longer necessary. Any references to this variable should be removed as it is no longer used.
  * Renames `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary__c-button--MarginRight` to `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--child--MarginRight` and `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary__c-button--MarginBottom` to `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--child--MarginBottom`. Any references you may have to these vars need to be updated to the new names.
  * Adds `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--child--MarginLeft`. The margin between secondary actions is now calculated from `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--child--MarginLeft` and `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--child--MarginRight` between adjacent buttons.
* Renames the following variables. Any references to the old vars will need to be updated to use the new vars.
  * Renames `--pf-c-empty-state--c-button--MarginTop` to `--pf-c-empty-state__primary--MarginTop`
  * Renames `--pf-c-empty-state--c-button__secondary--MarginTop` to `--pf-c-empty-state__primary--secondary--MarginTop`

## fix(table): replaced expanded content box shadow with border [(#2861)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2861)
*  The variable `--pf-c-table__expandable-row--m-expanded--BoxShadow` has been removed. All instances of this should be deleted from the application.

  * `--pf-c-wizard--m-in-page__nav--lg--BorderRightWidth`
  * `--pf-c-wizard--m-in-page__nav--lg--BorderRightColor`

## fix(modal): updated box shadow size [(#2859)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2859)
* changes box shadow from lg to xl. This is a visual breaking change only. No further action required to consume this change.

## fix(clipboard-copy): replaced expandable box-shadow with border [(#2856)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2856)
This change replaces the expandable content's box-shadow with a border and removes the transparent border around the expandable content box. This is a visual change only. No further updates are needed to consume this change.

* removes `--pf-c-page__main-nav--PaddingBottom`
* removes `--pf-c-page__main-breadcrumb--md--PaddingTop`
* removes `--pf-c-page__main-nav--main-breadcrumb--PaddingTop`


Also reduced the space between the breadcrumb section and page section that is below it to `var(--pf-global--spacer--md)`. This is a visual change only. No other updates are required to consume this change.

## fix(colors): update cyan-600 cyan-700 blue-600 and blue-700 [(#2832)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2832)

## fix(button): add modifiers to position icon in button [(#2828)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2828)
* Adds the modifiers `pf-m-start` and `pf-m-end` to position `pf-c-button__icon` in the button component depending on whether it comes before or after text. We made this change so that we could safely position the icon before or after text, without needing to introduce a new class that wraps the text. **If you are using a button with an icon, you will need to use one of these modifiers to style the icon .**

Removes the following variables. Any references to them will need to be removed as they are no longer used in PatternFly.
*  `  --pf-c-button__icon--MarginRight`
* `--pf-c-button__text--icon--MarginLeft`.

Removes the following class. Any references to it will need to be removed as it is no longer used in PatternFly.

  * Updated all components that use `$pf-global--BackgroundColor--150` or `$pf-global--BackgroundColor--300` to use  `$pf-global--BackgroundColor--200` instead.
  * Any references to the variables that were removed should be reviewed, and can be updated to use `--pf-global--BackgroundColor--200`/`$pf-global--BackgroundColor--200` instead. However you might want to consult your visual designer first. 

The values for these global color variables has changed. These are visual changes only. No further updates are needed to consume these changes.

* `$pf-color-black-200` changes from `#ededed ` to `#f0f0f0`
* `$pf-color-black-600` changes from `#737679` to `#6a6e73`

## fix(components): change components to be mobile first [(#2816)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2816)
This PR addresses components using `max-width`, and coverts them to use `min-width `in an effort to be “mobile-first”. One component that cannot satisfy this is the table. At the mobile viewport, native/default properties are modified to achieve a grid based layout. To overwrite these changes would require adding back native properties to the table. For that reason, the table will remain the exception to a “mobile-first” approach.

The components that are now mobile-first are: background image, data list, data toolbar, form, login, page, toolbar, and wizard.

Changes the following variable names. The original variable should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly.

* `--pf-c-data-list__item-content--PaddingBottom` changes to `--pf-c-data-list__item-content--md--PaddingBottom`
* `--pf-c-data-list__item-action--not-last-child--lg--MarginBottom` changes to `--pf-c-data-list__item-action--not-last-child--MarginBottom`
* `--pf-c-data-list__expandable-content--md--MaxHeight` changes to `--pf-c-data-list__expandable-content--MaxHeight`
* `--pf-c-data-list__item-content--PaddingBottom` changes to `--pf-c-data-list__item-content--md--PaddingBottom`
* `--pf-c-login__header--sm--PaddingLeft` changes to `--pf-c-login__header--PaddingLeft`
* `--pf-c-login__header--sm--PaddingRight` changes to `--pf-c-login__header--PaddingRight`
* `--pf-c-login__main--xl--MarginBottom` changes to `--pf-c-login__main--MarginBottom`
* `--pf-c-login__footer--sm--PaddingLeft` changes to `--pf-c-login__footer--PaddingLeft`
* `--pf-c-login__footer--sm--PaddingRight` changes to `--pf-c-login__footer--PaddingRight`

Removes the following variables. Any references to them will need to be removed as they are no longer used in PatternFly.

* Removes `--pf-c-page__main-section--m-no-padding-mobile--md--PaddingTop`
* Removes `--pf-c-page__main-section--m-no-padding-mobile--md--PaddingRight`
* Removes `--pf-c-page__main-section--m-no-padding-mobile--md--PaddingBottom`
* Removes `--pf-c-page__main-section--m-no-padding-mobile--md--PaddingLeft`

Update your application if it uses `.pf-m-no-padding-mobile`. This PR removes that class from PatternFly. Instead we introduce the following variables:

* Introduces `.pf-m-no-padding{-on-[breakpoint]}` which removes padding from the main page section at an optional breakpoint.
* Introduces `.pf-m-padding{-on-[breakpoint]}` which modifies the main page section to add padding back in at a specified breakpoint. Should be used with pf-m-no-padding.

Changes the value of the global gutter. If you were using the global-gutter you may need to now use `global--gutter--md`

* `$pf-global--gutter:` now has the value  `$pf-global--spacer--md`
* `$pf-global--gutter--md` now has the value `$pf-global--spacer--lg`

## fix(radio, check): fixed radio left margin overflow, error in selector [(#2799)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2799)
Adds a `1px` left margin to a radio component's input element when it comes before the label. This is a visual change only and no further updates are needed to consume this change.

## fix(datalist): update compact font-size [(#2777)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2777)
* Changes compact data-list font-size to `--pf-global--FontSize--sm`. This is a visual change only. No further updates are needed to consume this change.

## fix(table): update compact spacing [(#2775)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2775)
The following changes are visual changes only. No updates are needed in an application to consume these changes.

* Changed compact table's header spacing from `--pf-global--spacer--md` top and bottom padding to `calc(var(--pf-global--spacer--sm) + var(--pf-global--spacer--xs))` top padding and `var(--pf-global--spacer--sm)` bottom padding.
* Changed compact table's responsive/grid spacers. All values changed from the default table's responsive spacers:
  * `<tr>` top/bottom padding changed to `var(--pf-global--spacer--sm)`
  * `<td>` top/bottom padding changed to `var(--pf-global--spacer--xs)`
  * `.pf-c-table__action` top/bottom margin set to `calc(var(--pf-global--spacer--xs) * -1);` to better align in the grid layout.
  * The expandable row toggle button's (`.pf-c-table__toggle .pf-c-button`) bottom margin set to`calc(#{pf-size-prem(6px)} * -1);` to reduce gap between toggle and expandable row content.

## fix(test): remove unused file [(#2771)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2771)
- thing 1
- thing 2

## fix(tooltip): reduced space around component [(#2763)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2763)

* Top and bottom padding changed from `--pf-global--spacer--md` to `--pf-global--spacer--sm`
* Left and right padding changed from `--pf-global--spacer--lg` to `--pf-global--spacer--md`

## fix(popover): reduced space between/around elements [(#2762)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2762)
* Title component size changes from `pf-m-xl` to `pf-m-md`. You will need to change the title component variation used in the popover component from `pf-m-xl` to `pf-m-md`

The following are visual changes to the component. No further updates are needed to consume these changes. 
* Top/right/bottom/left padding changed from `--pf-global--spacer--xl` to `--pf-global--spacer--md`
* Increased right padding of element displayed to the left of the close button to make more room for the close button. That padding changed from `--pf-global--spacer--xl` to `--pf-global--spacer--2xl`
* Popover's `font-size` changed to `--pf-global--FontSize--sm`
* Space below title changed from `--pf-global--spacer--md` to `--pf-global--spacer--sm`
* Space above footer changed from `--pf-global--spacer--lg` to `--pf-global--spacer--md`

## fix(modal): reduced spacing [(#2761)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2761)

  * `--pf-c-accordion--PaddingTop`
  * `--pf-c-accordion--PaddingBottom`

## fix(form-control): enabled success/invalid states for readonly controls [(#2753)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2753)
Instead of styling the shorthand `background` to add the status icon for the success and invalid states, we're now styling the individual background properties that need to change. As result, the `background` property declarations that were used to add the status icons and their associated variables have been removed.

This PR removes the following variables. Developers should remove any reference to them in their code as they are no longer used.
*  `--pf-c-form-control--success--check--Background`
*  `--pf-c-form-control--success--Background`
*  `--pf-c-form-control__select--arrow--Background`
*  `--pf-c-form-control__select--Background`
*  `--pf-c-form-control__select--invalid--Background`
*  `--pf-c-form-control__select--success--Background`
