## fix(emptystate): split single padding var to top/right/bottom/left [(#3092)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3092)
This PR removes `--pf-c-empty-state--Padding`. Any reference to that variable should be removed as it is no longer used.

To change the empty state outer padding, use `--pf-c-empty-state--PaddingTop`, `--pf-c-empty-state--PaddingRight`, `--pf-c-empty-state--PaddingBottom`, and `--pf-c-empty-state--PaddingLeft` instead.

## fix(page): removed pf-m-mobile/icon/user, added hidden/visible [(#3091)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3091)
* Adds `.pf-c-page__header-tools-item`, as a child of `.pf-c-page__header-tools-group` to wrap header tools items. All items should now be wrapped in `.pf-c-page__header-tools-item`.
  * `.pf-c-page__header-tools-group` is required as a parent of `.pf-c-page__header-tools-item`
* Removed the classes `.pf-m-icon`, `.pf-m-mobile`, and `.pf-m-user`, which were classes that allowed responsive hiding/showing of toolbar elements. These classes have been removed. Any reference to them should be removed.
* Adds `.pf-m-hidden[-on-{breakpoint}]` and `.pf-m-visible[-on-{breakpoint}]` that can be applied to `pf-c-page__header-tools-[item/group]`. These classes replace `.pf-m-[icon/mobile/user]` for hiding/showing header tools items and groups.

## fix(modal-box): added __header element [(#3084)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3084)
This PR adds a new element `header.pf-c-modal-box__header` that wraps the `.pf-c-modal-box__title` and `.pf-c-modal-box__description` elements. All instances of `.pf-c-modal-box__title` and `.pf-c-modal-box__description` should be wrapped in `.pf-c-modal-box__header`

The following variables were renamed. Any reference to the old name should be updated to reference the new name.
  * `--pf-c-modal-box__title--PaddingTop` renamed to `--pf-c-modal-box__header--PaddingTop`
  * `--pf-c-modal-box__title--PaddingRight` renamed to `--pf-c-modal-box__header--PaddingRight`
  * `--pf-c-modal-box__title--PaddingLeft` renamed to `--pf-c-modal-box__header--PaddingLeft`
  * `--pf-c-modal-box__title--last-child--PaddingBottom` renamed to `--pf-c-modal-box__header--last-child--PaddingBottom`
  * `--pf-c-modal-box__title--body--PaddingTop` renamed to `--pf-c-modal-box__header--body--PaddingTop`

The following variables were removed. Any reference to them should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly.
  * `--pf-c-modal-box__description--PaddingRight`
  * `--pf-c-modal-box__description--PaddingLeft`
  * `--pf-c-modal-box__description--last-child--PaddingBottom`
  * `--pf-c-modal-box__description--body--PaddingTop`

## fix(table-vars): updated min-width vars, removed unused [(#3074)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3074)
The following variables have been removed. Any reference to them should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly:
* `--pf-c-table--thead--cell--Width`

## fix(datalist): fix shadows on selected rows [(#3068)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3068)
TBD

## fix(page): removed unnecessary vars [(#3066)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3066)
The CSS var `--pf-c-page__header-sidebar-toggle__c-button--xl--MarginLeft` was removed. All instances of this should be removed as it is no longer used in patternfly.

## refactor(nav-structure): removed __simple-list, added support for -m-horizontal/-m-tertiary at root [(#3062)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3062)
This PR allows for navigation to be modified at the component root with `.pf-m-horizontal`, `.pf-m-tertiary` and `.pf-m-light` (vertical orientation only). The list component is now styled contextually by `.pf-c-nav__section`, `.pf-c-nav__subnav`, `.pf-c-nav__horizontal`, `.pf-c-nav__tertiary`. 

`.pf-c-nav__simple-list`, `.pf-c-nav__horizontal-list` and `.pf-c-nav__tertiary-list` have been replaced by `.pf-c-nav__list`.

The following classes have been removed. Any reference to them should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly:
* `.pf-c-nav__simple-list`
* `.pf-c-nav__horizontal-list`
* `.pf-c-nav__tertiary-list`

The following variables have been renamed. Any reference to the old variable should be updated to use the new variable:
* `--pf-c-nav__horizontal-list__link` has changed to `--pf-c-nav--m-horizontal__link` in all instances
* `--pf-c-nav__tertiary-list__link` has changed to `--pf-c-nav--m-tertiary__link` in all instances
* `--pf-c-nav--subnav__simple-list` has changed to `--pf-c-nav__subnav__link` in all instances

Some of the general CSS structure has also changed, so please reference the [file changeset](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3062/files).

## fix(chip-group): refactored structure so chip-group no longer nests [(#3058)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3058)
This PR introduces breaking structural changes to the chip and chip group components.

The structure has changed to

#### Plain chip groups (no label)
```
div.chip-group
  ul.chip-group-list[aria-label="foo"][role="list"]
    li.chip-group-list-item
       div.chip
```

#### Chip groups with label
```
div.chip-group
  span.chip-group-title[aria-hidden="true"][id="foo"]
  ul.chip-group-list[aria-labelledby="foo"][role="list"]
    li.chip-0-list-item
       div.chip
    li.chip-group-list-item
       div.chip
```

* The outer `.pf-c-chip-group` element should now always be a `<div>`. All instances of `.pf-c-chip-group` should be updated to be a `<div>`.
* `.pf-c-chip-group__label` is now a `<span>` instead of a heading element.
* `.pf-c-chip-group__label` should have an `id` value that will be used as the value for `aria-labelledby` on the `ul.pf-c-chip-group__list` element.
* Since the text in `.pf-c-chip-group__label` is read to screen readers via `aria-labelledby` on the `pf-c-chip-group__list` element, `.pf-c-chip-group__label` should now also have `aria-hidden="true"`.
* The list of chips inside of a chip group should be wrapped in a `<ul>` with the class `pf-c-chip-group__list`. 
* `.pf-c-chip-group__list` should have a (redundant) `role="list"` assigned. This is needed for screen readers to announce the list properly.
* Chips inside of `.pf-c-chip-group__list` should each be wrapped with a `li.pf-c-chip-group__list-item` element. 
* Chips are now a `<div>` by default now. When used in a chip-group, `div.pf-c-chip` is a child of `ul.pf-c-chip-group__list > li.pf-c-chip-group__list-item`

The following variables were renamed. All instances of the old variable should be updated to reference the new variable instead.
* `--pf-c-chip-group--MarginBottom` was renamed to `--pf-c-chip-group__list--MarginBottom`
* `--pf-c-chip-group__label--PaddingRight` was renamed to `--pf-c-chip-group__label--MarginRight`
* `--pf-c-chip-group__label--Maxwidth` was renamed to `--pf-c-chip-group__label--Maxwidth`
* `--pf-c-chip-group--c-chip--MarginRight` was changed to `--pf-c-chip-group__list-item--MarginRight`
* `--pf-c-chip-group--c-chip--MarginBottom` was changed to `--pf-c-chip-group__list-item--MarginBottom`

## fix(pagination): updated bottom pagination design [(#3050)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3050)
This PR makes a number of changes to the pagination component.

* The bottom pagination mobile design has changed. On mobile viewports, the bottom pagination now spans the width of the parent container and is "sticky" to the bottom of the viewport and will remain at the bottom of the viewport as content above it scrolls. This behavior can be disabled by applying `.pf-m-static` to the `.pf-c-pagination` component.
  * Since the pagination now spans the width of it's parent container on mobile, it should not be used in a toolbar, and the bottom pagination should be placed directly after the element the pagination is for (data-list, table, etc).
  * On desktop screens, the pagination retains its original design, which matches the top pagination.
* Renames the bottom pagination from `.pf-m-footer` to `.pf-m-bottom` to align with React. All use of `.pf-c-pagination.pf-m-footer` should change to `.pf-c-pagination.pf-m-bottom`.
  * All pagination component CSS variables with `m-footer` in the string should change to `m-bottom`. 
* The buttons used in `.pf-c-pagination__nav` are now individually wrapped with `div.pf-c-pagination__nav-control`, and this new element has modifiers `.pf-m-first`, `.pf-m-prev`, `.pf-m-next`, and `.pf-m-last` to indicate the first, previous, next, and last buttons. The "first" button should now be wrapped in `<div class="pf-c-pagination__nav-control pf-m-first">// first button</div>`, the "next" wrapped in `<div class="pf-c-pagination__nav-control pf-m-next">// next button</div>`, and so on.
* The following variables were renamed and the old variable name should be updated to reflect the new name
  * `--pf-c-pagination__nav--c-button--PaddingLeft` changed to `--pf-c-pagination__nav-control--c-button--PaddingLeft`
  * `--pf-c-pagination__nav--c-button--PaddingRight` changed to `--pf-c-pagination__nav-control--c-button--PaddingRight`
  * `--pf-c-pagination__nav--c-button--FontSize` changed to `--pf-c-pagination__nav-control--c-button--FontSize`
  * `--pf-c-pagination--m-compact__nav--c-button--MarginLeft` changed to `--pf-c-pagination--m-compact__nav-control--nav-control--MarginLeft`

## fix(button): updated control variation disabled state [(#3049)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3049)
#### Button

This PR updates the visuals of the control button disabled state.

* The following variables were removed. All references to them should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly.
  * `--pf-c-button--m-control--disabled--after--BorderTopColor`
  * `--pf-c-button--m-control--disabled--after--BorderRightColor`
  * `--pf-c-button--m-control--disabled--after--BorderBottomColor`
  * `--pf-c-button--m-control--disabled--after--BorderLeftColor`

#### Form Control

* `--pf-c-form-control--readonly--focus--BackgroundColor` was renamed to `--pf-c-form-control--readonly--BackgroundColor`. All references to the old variable name should be updated to reference the new variable name instead.
* `--pf-c-form-control--readonly--focus--PaddingBottom` was removed. Any reference to it should be removed as it is no longer used in patternfly.

## fix(pagination): removed options menu per page text styling [(#3047)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3047)
This PR removes the `.pf-c-pagination__menu-text` element from the pagination options menu items. The options menu item text should just be normal text.

Any use of the class `.pf-c-pagination__menu-text` or the vars `--pf-c-pagination__menu-text--PaddingLeft`, `--pf-c-pagination__menu-text--FontSize` and `--pf-c-pagination__menu-text--Color` should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly.

## fix(data-toolbar): renamed data-toolbar to toolbar [(#3046)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3046)
This PR renames the `.pf-c-data-toolbar` component to `.pf-c-toolbar`. All use of the `.pf-c-data-toolbar*` classes and `--pf-c-data-toolbar*` variables should be updated to be `.pf-c-toolbar*` and `--pf-c-toolbar*` instead.

## fix(toolbar): removed toolbar layout [(#3045)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3045)
This PR removes the `.pf-l-toolbar` from PatternFly. Any use of the layout, classes, CSS vars, etc should be removed.

## fix(toolbar): removes pf-c-toolbar component [(#3039)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3039)
This PR removes the `.pf-c-toolbar` component. This component is being replaced with what is currently the `.pf-c-data-toolbar` component, which will be renamed to `.pf-c-toolbar` in a subsequent PR.

All use of the `.pf-c-toolbar` component - classes, variables, etc should be removed as the component is removed from PatternFly.

TBD

## fix(card): moved __header to __title, __head to __header [(#3035)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3035)
This PR renames the `.pf-c-card__header` element to `.pf-c-card__title`, and removes the dependency of `.pf-c-title` from `.pf-c-card__title`. And that allows us to rename `.pf-c-card__head` to `.pf-c-card__header`.

The following elements' classes have changed. Any reference to the old class should be updated to reference the new class instead.

* `.pf-c-card__header` has been renamed to `.pf-c-card__title`.  Also `.pf-c-title` and the title size modifiers should be removed from `.pf-c-card__title`.
* `.pf-c-card__head` has been renamed to `.pf-c-card__header`. 
* `.pf-c-card__head-main` has been renamed to `.pf-c-card__header-main`.

The following variables were renamed. Any reference to the old variable name should be updated to reference the new name instead.

* `--pf-c-card--m-compact__header--not--last-child--PaddingBottom` was renamed to `--pf-c-card--m-compact__title--not--last-child--PaddingBottom`
* `--pf-c-card__header--FontFamily` was renamed to `--pf-c-card__title--FontFamily`
* `--pf-c-card__header--FontWeight` was renamed to `--pf-c-card__title--FontWeight`

## fix(backdrop): removed blur, renamed var [(#3009)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/3009)
This PR removes the blur from the backdrop component. This is a visual change only and no further updates are needed to consume this change.

The variable `--pf-c-backdrop--BackdropFilter` was removed. Any reference to it should be removed as it is no longer used in patternfly.

## fix(modal): added title, moved padding from container to elements [(#2969)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2969)
This PR moves the outer padding on the modal from the `.pf-c-modal-box` container to the modal box elements that are children of the modal. To better achieve this spacing, we have dropped the use of the title component to serve as the modal title, and this is now an element of the modal component called `.pf-c-modal-box__title`. Any instance of `.pf-c-title` in the modal that serves as the modal title should be replaced with `.pf-c-modal-box__title`.

The following variables have been removed. Any references to them should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly.
* `--pf-c-modal-box--PaddingTop`
  * This can now be achieved using `--pf-c-modal-box__[modal element]--PaddingTop`, however it's important to note that this variable changes depending on the markup present in the modal, so this variable serves multiple purpopses. And it will need to be modified for each child of the modal component that touches the top edge of the modal.
* `--pf-c-modal-box--PaddingRight`
  * This can now be achieved using `--pf-c-modal-box__[modal element]--PaddingRight`. However it will need to be modified for each child of the modal component that touches the right edge of the modal.
* `--pf-c-modal-box--PaddingBottom`
  * This can now be achieved using `--pf-c-modal-box__[modal element]--last-child--PaddingBottom`. However it will need to be modified for each child of the modal component that touches the bottom edge of the modal.
* `--pf-c-modal-box--PaddingLeft`
  * This can now be achieved using `--pf-c-modal-box__[modal element]--PaddingLeft`. However it will need to be modified for each child of the modal component that touches the left edge of the modal.

The following variables have been renamed. Any reference to the old name should be updated to reference the new name.
* `--pf-c-modal-box--body--MinHeight` renamed to `--pf-c-modal-box__body--MinHeight`
* `--pf-c-modal-box__c-title--description--MarginTop` ranamed to `--pf-c-modal-box__title--description--PaddingTop`
* `--pf-c-modal-box__description--body--MarginTop` renamed to `--pf-c-modal-box__description--body--PaddingTop`
* `--pf-c-modal-box--c-title--body--MarginTop` renamed to `--pf-c-modal-box__title--body--PaddingTop`
* `--pf-c-modal-box__footer--MarginTop` renamed to `--pf-c-modal-box__footer--PaddingTop`

## fix(table-row-height): fixed borders, row height, focus [(#2965)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2965)
This PR fixes multiple table issues. 
* Adds dedicated table button `.pf-c-table__button`: this button relies on `::after` pseudo element to define clickable area, as previous height hacks cause cross browser bugs. `focus-ring` is disabled on this button and applied to the parent table cell.
* Adds `.pf-c-table__button-content` to `.pf-c-table__sort` for layout as `button` s don't yet support `display: grid`.
* Hover, focus, active and selected states `.pf-c-table__sort` and `.pf-c-table__compound-expansion-toggle`: updates border discrepancies using `::before` and `::after` pseudos and negative offsets.
* Adds text wrapping control `.pf-m-truncate`, `.pf-m-wrap`, `.pf-m-no-wrap`, `.pf-m-break-word` and `.pf-m-fit-content`.
* Adds `.pf-c-table__text` wrapper for grid layout truncation/wrapping control.

The following variables have been renamed. Any reference to the old variable should be updated to use the new variable:
* All instances of `--pf-c-table-cell--` has changed to `--pf-c-table--cell--`

`.pf-m-height-auto` is no longer necessary, so the modifier class was removed. All instances of it should be removed.

Some of the general CSS structure has also changed, so please reference the [file changeset](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2965/files).

## fix(components): removed transparent borders [(#2963)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2963)
This PR removes a transparent border from a handful of components that was used to serve as a border in Windows high contrast mode. We no longer support specific styling for high contrast mode.

This PR removes the following variables. Any references to them should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly:

* `--pf-c-app-launcher__menu--BorderWidth`
* `--pf-c-context-selector__menu--BorderWidth`
* `--pf-c-dropdown__menu--BorderWidth`
* `--pf-c-modal-box--BorderColor`
* `--pf-c-modal-box--BorderSize`
* `--pf-c-options-menu__menu--BorderWidth`
* `--pf-c-select__menu--BorderWidth`

## fix(global): hid vertical nav at 1200px, updated component spacing [(#2962)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2962)
This PR changes the CSS breakpoint at which the page component's sidebar shows and hides. This used to be defined at `$pf-global--breakpoint--md` (768px) and is now defined at `$pf-global--breakpoint--xl` (1200px). This change results in a wider main content area of the page, so this may impact an application's UI. No code changes are needed to allow the breakpoint change, since the breakpoint is defined in CSS.

The overall page chrome and some individual components' horizontal spacing becomes more compact at this breakpoint (true of the old breakpoint and the new), so applications may find that custom elements that aligned with the old page chrome may not align now since the chrome spacing changes at 1200px instead of 768px. An application may need to make updates to match the chrome's spacing at the new breakpoint.

There is a long list of variable names that have changed across individual components that you can find in this PR's [file changeset](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2962/files). 

This PR also changes the gutter in patternfly layouts (gallery, grid, level, split, stack) to have a single gutter instead of responsive, so the gutter is always 16px, instead of being 16px on mobile and 24px on desktop. No futher changes are needed to consume this update, though applications may find that custom elements that may have aligned with the spacing at the old breakpoint no longer align. An application may need to make updates to match spacing at the new breakpoint.

The page sidebar and vertical navigation are now always the same size between mobile and desktop. No further updates are needed to consume this change.

## fix(chipgroup): clarify chip group behavior [(#2961)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2961)

- `--pf-c-chip--m-overflow--hover--before--BorderColor`
- `--pf-c-chip--m-overflow--active--before--BorderColor`
- `--pf-c-chip--m-overflow--focus--before--BorderColor`

- Removes the following variables from the Chip Group component. All instances of the variable should be removed from your application:
- `--pf-c-chip--m-overflow--hover--before--BorderColor`

- Replaces `--pf-c-chip-group--m-toolbar-PaddingLeft` with `--pf-c-chip-group--m-category--PaddingLeft`
- Replaces `--pf-c-chip-group--m-toolbar-BorderRadius` with `--pf-c-chip-group--m-category--BorderRadius`
- Replaces `--pf-c-chip-group--m-toolbar--BackgroundColor` with `--pf-c-chip-group--m-category--BackgroundColor`

## feat(global): made redhat font default, add opt-in for overpass [(#2955)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2955)
This PR removes the `.pf-m-redhat-font` class from PatternFly that changed the base font families to a new Red Hat font as well as changed base styles for a number of components to be used with the Red Hat font. The Red Hat font and its associated component styles are now the default font in PatternFly. If an application was using `.pf-m-redhat-font` before, it can safely be removed as that class and the default styles should now match what they were before.

If an application wants to continue using the Overpass font, this PR introduces a class `.pf-m-overpass-font` that works in the exact same way as `.pf-m-redhat-font` did. It changes the base font families to Overpass fonts, and applies specific component styling to be used with Overpass. To enable Overpass in your application, simply wrap your application in an element with `.pf-m-overpass-font`. This is most commonly applied to the `<body>` element, though it can apply to any element that wraps your application. It can also be used to wrap individual components if that is more desirable.

The following are breaking changes that accompany these updates:

* If an application is not using `.pf-m-overpass-font`, the card title is now bold. This is a visual change only. No further code updates are needed to consume this change.

* The following variables have been removed as they are no longer necessary. Any reference to them should be removed from an application as they are no longer used in patternfly.
  * `--pf-global--link--FontWeight` 
  * `--pf-global--FontFamily--redhatfont--sans-serif`
  * `--pf-global--FontFamily--redhatfont--heading--sans-serif`
  * `--pf-global--FontFamily--redhatfont--monospace`
  * `--pf-global--FontWeight--redhatfont--bold`
  * `--pf-c-breadcrumb__item--FontWeight`
  * `--pf-c-breadcrumb__link--FontWeight`
  * `--pf-c-content--blockquote--FontWeight`
  * `--pf-c-expandable-section__toggle--FontWeight`

## refactor(separators-to-dividers): remove component separators, add dividers [(#2944)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2944)
This PR removes component separators and replaces them with `.pf-c-divider` for the following components.  
* [App Launcher](https://patternfly-pr-2944.surge.sh/documentation/core/components/applauncher)
* [Data Toolbar](https://patternfly-pr-2944.surge.sh/documentation/core/components/datatoolbar)

* `.pf-c-data-toolbar__item.pf-m-separator`
* `.pf-c-dropdown__separator`
* `.pf-c-options-menu__separator`
* `.pf-c-select__separator`

* `--pf-c-select__separator--Height`
* `--pf-c-select__separator--BackgroundColor`
* `--pf-c-select__separator--MarginTop`
* `--pf-c-select__separator--MarginBottom`

The following variables have been renamed. Any reference to the old variable should be updated to use the new variable:

* `--pf-c-dropdown__c-divider--MarginBottom` has changed to `--pf-c-dropdown--c-divider--MarginBottom`
* `--pf-c-options-menu__c-divider--MarginTop` has changed to `--pf-c-options-menu--c-divider--MarginTop`
* `--pf-c-options-menu__c-divider--MarginBottom` has changed to `--pf-c-options-menu--c-divider--MarginBottom`

## feat(label): refactored label component [(#2943)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2943)
The label component has been redesigned and refactored.

The `.pf-m-compact` modifier has been removed and any reference of that class should be removed as it is no longer in patternfly.

The label now requires a `.pf-c-label__content` child that contains the label text and an optional `.pf-c-label__icon` wrapper for an icon that is displayed to the left of the text. You can also add an optional `.pf-c-button.pf-m-plain` element as the last child of the label as a close button.

The label can also be used as an `<a>` element in the case that it is a link.

There is a `.pf-m-outline` variation available as an alternate design.

And you can choose from `.pf-m-[blue/green/orange/red/purple/cyan]` as colors for the label.

This PR introduces breaking visual and code changes. At a minimum to update to the new label component, the `.pf-c-label` component now requires `.pf-c-label__content` element to wrap the label text. And the label will be grey by default now, so to achieve the previous blue styling, the closest match visually would be using the new `.pf-m-blue` modifier. However, reference the new component documentation and the PR changeset for more info regarding the changes https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2943/files

## fix(global vars): updated pf-color-green-50 [(#2940)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2940)
This PR changes `$pf-color-green-50` to `#f3faf2`. This is a visual change only. No further updates are needed to consume this change.

## fix(optionsmenu): added color declaration to menu items [(#2938)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2938)
Adds a `color` declaration for `.pf-c-options-menu__menu-item` items so that the color will always match the default text color (`--pf-global--Color--100)`. Since this wasn't defined previously, if applications were using `<a>` elements as menu items, the item color would have been the default blue link color. This is a visual change only, no further updates are needed to consume this change.

## fix(expandable): renamed expandable to expandable section [(#2937)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2937)
This PR renames the expandable component to expandable section. As result, all of the names for elements, variables, modifiers, component classes, etc have changed to reference "expandable-section" instead of "expandable."

Any instance of the old name in an application should be updated to reference the new name. See the full list of changes for details - https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2937/files

## fix(wizard): made desktop nav 250px, remove compact modifier [(#2936)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2936)
This PR changes the wizard nav width (`--pf-c-wizard__nav--lg--Width`) from 300px to 250px on desktop. A 250px width was previously achieved using the `.pf-m-compact-nav` modifier, however since the nav width is now 250px by default, the `.pf-m-compact-nav` modifier has been removed and any reference to that class should be removed as it is no longer in patternfly.

The following variables have also been removed and any reference to them should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly.
* `--pf-c-wizard--m-compact-nav__nav--lg--Width`
* `--pf-c-wizard--m-in-page__nav--lg--Width`

## fix(inputgroup): remove legacy button styles [(#2935)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2935)

* `--pf-c-content--ul--MarginTop`

## fix(form): moved helper text icon from login to form component [(#2928)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2928)
This PR moves the form helper text icon feature from the login component back into the form component.

* The `.pf-c-form__helper-text-icon` styles have moved from the login component stylesheet to the form component stylesheet
* Removes the following variables from the login component and replaces the variables in the form component. If you're overriding any of these using the `.pf-c-login` component selector, you will need to update the selector to `.pf-c-form`.
  * `--pf-c-login__main-body--c-form__helper-text-icon--FontSize` has been renamed to `--pf-c-form__helper-text-icon--FontSize`
  * `--pf-c-login__main-body--c-form__helper-text-icon--MarginRight` has been renamed to `--pf-c-form__helper-text-icon--MarginRight`

## fix(components): add wrapper with classname to all icons [(#2927)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2927)
*The following classes should be removed from icons directly and moved to a new element that wraps the icon.
* `.pf-c-accordion__toggle-icon`

* The icon in `.pf-c-options-menu__toggle-button` should be wrapped in a new element with class `.pf-c-options-menu__toggle-button-icon`

* The icon in the button in `.pf-c-table__toggle` should be wrapped with a new element with class `.pf-c-table__toggle-icon`

* The icon in the button in `.pf-c-data-list__toggle` should be wrapped with a new element with class `.pf-c-data-list__toggle-icon` - wrapper should be a `<div>`

* The icon in `.pf-c-nav__toggle` should be wrapped in a new element with class `.pf-c-nav__toggle-icon`

* removes the variable `--pf-c-expandable-section__toggle-icon--MarginRight`

## fix(wizard): move modifier to body [(#2924)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2924)
* Moves `pf-m-no-padding` from `.pf-c-wizard__main` to `.pf-c-wizard__main-body` . The same styling will occur to the wizard main body. If you want to remove padding in the wizard main body you should add `pf-m-no-padding` to `.pf-c-wizard__main-body` now.

* Removes `--pf-c-data-list__item-action--not-last-child--MarginBottom` all instances of it should be removed from your application.

* Removes `flex-wrap: wrap` from the data list actions. When the list of buttons get too long you should use the overflow menu to hide buttons, instead of flex-wrap, as we don't support this anymore.

## fix(clipboardcopy): replace copy button with button component [(#2922)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2922)
* Removes the elements with classes `.pf-c-clipboard-copy__group-toggle` and `.pf-c-clipboard-copy__group-copy`. All instances of these elements should be removed from your application and replaced with the button control component: `.pf-c-button.pf-m-control` .

* Renames the following variables. Any references of these variables should be update to reference the new variable name.
  * `--pf-c-clipboard-copy__group-toggle-icon--Transition` to `--pf-c-clipboard-copy__toggle-icon--Transition`

  * `--pf-c-clipboard-copy__group-copy--focus--BorderBottomColor`

## fix(alerts): update styling for better accessibility [(#2921)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2921)
* Updates the global info color - `$pf-global--info-color--100` from `$pf-color-blue-200` to  `$pf-color-blue-300`. This is a visual breaking change only. No further changes are needed to consume this change. If you were using the global info color in your application this change will visually effect your UI.

* The variable name `--pf-c-alert--grid-template-columns` changed to `--pf-c-alert--GridTemplateColumns`. Any instance of `--pf-c-alert--grid-template-columns` should be replaced with `--pf-c-alert--GridTemplateColumns`

* The icon used in the alert is `fas fa-fw fa-[alert-icon-name]` as it controls the width of the icon.

* The only action that should go in `.pf-c-alert__action` is the close button. All other actions should be in a new element with the class `pf-c-alert__action-group` that should be appended to `.pf-c-alert`

*Removed these variables:
  *  `--pf-c-alert--grid-template-rows`
  * `--pf-c-alert__icon--Padding`
  * `--pf-c-alert__icon--BackgroundColor`

## fix(tabs): Update class name for tabs button to be tabs link [(#2919)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2919)
* Renames the class `pf-c-tabs__button` to be `pf-c-tabs__link`. Any instances of the old class should be updated to the new class.

* Updates any tabs CSS variable with a reference to the BEM element `__button` to `__link`. Any references to tabs variables with `__button` should be replaced with `__link`.
E.g. `--pf-c-tabs--m-box__button--BackgroundColor` becomes `--pf-c-tabs--m-box__link--BackgroundColor`

## fix(breadcrumb): add word-break, display link and icon inline, move divider [(#2916)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2916)
This PR changes the visual appearance of breadcrumbs when they break to multiple lines.
* The text will now break if there is a long string in an item link that is wider than the viewport
* The divider is displayed before the link text, instead of after it
* The divider will also always appear inline with the item text instead of wrapping to a new line in some cases.

Because the divider comes before the link text now, the variable `--pf-c-breadcrumb__item-divider--MarginLeft` has been replaced with `--pf-c-breadcrumb__item-divider--MarginRight`. Any instance of the old variable should be replaced with the new one.

Any reference to the divider element (`.pf-c-breadcrumb__item-divider`) will need to be moved in the markup to come before the breadcrumb link element (`.pf-c-breadcrumb__link`) instead of after it.

## fix(radio): fixed issue where radio is cut off when comes after label [(#2912)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2912)
Adds a `1px` right margin to a radio component's input element when it comes after the label. This is a visual change only and no further updates are needed to consume this change.

## feat(colors): added new cyan, gold, green, red colors, updated blue [(#2906)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2906)
Updates `$pf-color-blue-50`/`--pf-global--palette--blue-50` from `#def3ff` to `#e7f1fa`. This is a visual change only, no further updates are needed to consume this change.

## fix(app launcher): applied external link icon class to icon wrapper [(#2904)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2904)
Moves the class `.pf-c-app-launcher__menu-item-external-icon` from the external link icon itself to a `<span>` that wraps the external link icon. Any instances of the external link icon should be wrapped in a `<span>` and the `.pf-c-app-launcher__menu-item-external-icon` class should be moved from the icon to the `<span>`.

## fix(drawer): removed m-border, enabled m-no-border on inline/static [(#2887)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2887)
* This PR removes the `.pf-m-border` variation as when the panel overlays content, a shadow should always be used instead of a border. And when the panel is inline with content (`pf-m-inline`, `pf-m-static`), a border should always be used instead of a shadow. Any reference to the `.pf-m-border` modifier class should be removed. 
* Enables `.pf-m-no-border` on inline and static variations, to remove the border if necessary. No updates are needed to consume this change as it is an added feature, but it's worth noting that the `.pf-m-no-border` class could have been used on inline and static drawer panels before, and would have simply done nothing. That class on the panels will now remove the border.

## fix(data-list): changed expanded content shadow to a border [(#2885)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2885)
* Replaces the box shadow on the expandable content element with a bottom border. This is a visual breaking change only and no further code changes are needed to consume this change.
* Removes `--pf-c-data-list__expandable-content--BoxShadow`,  `--pf-c-data-list__item--before--Height`, and `--pf-c-data-list__item-item--before--Height`. Any instances of these variables in your application should be removed as they are no longer used.
* Replaces `--pf-c-data-list__item--m-expanded__expandable-content--BorderTopWidth` with `--pf-c-data-list__expandable-content--BorderTopWidth`. Any instances of the old variable should be updated to the new variable.

## style(vertical-nav): refactored css structure [(#2884)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2884)
The nav component's css was refactored, see the file list for details on what changed 
https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2884/files

This PR:
1. Applies stylistic updates to css variables rather than redefining component elements.
2. Updates `--pf-c-nav__c-nested-component--Property` to `--pf-c-nav--c-nested-component--Property`. Any instances of the old variable should be updated to the new variable.
3. Updates visual style of navigation only, no HTML updates are necessary.

## fix(page): updated page and page header background colors [(#2883)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2883)
* Changes `--pf-c-page--BackgroundColor` from `--pf-global--BackgroundColor--dark-100` to `--pf-global--BackgroundColor--light-300`. This is just a visual change, no code updates are needed to consume it.
* Adds a background-color of `--pf-global--BackgroundColor--dark-100` to `.pf-c-page__header`. This is just a visual change, no code updates are needed to consume it.

## fix(modal): left aligned footer actions, removed pf-m-align-left [(#2881)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2881)
* Buttons in the modal footer are now left-aligned by default. No further updates are needed to consume this change.
* `.pf-m-align-left` has been removed as it is no longer needed. It can be removed from any modal footer elements it is currently applied to.
* Removed `--pf-c-modal-box__footer__c-button--first-of-type--MarginLeft`. Any reference to it should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly.

## feat(base): made shield styles optional by default (#2769) [(#2872)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2872)
The "shield" styles were intended to help resolve styling issues when using PF3 and PF4 together, but shouldn't be necessary for most PF users and is causing issues (https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/issues/2276 as an example) as PatternFly evolves. 

This PR removes the global styles provided by https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/_shield-inheritable.scss and https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/_shield-noninheritable.scss, and makes them optional for applications to include.

If an application is importing its own SCSS, and needs to include these shield styles, `$pf-global--enable-shield` can be set to `true`, which enables the shield SCSS to be built in [_base.scss](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/_base.scss) or [patternfly.scss](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/patternfly.scss) (which imports `_base.scss`).
https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/14ab259521d3838f8a8e19411c41610f9d8783b4/src/patternfly/_base.scss#L10-L13


Applications can also import either the SCSS or compiled CSS via https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/patternfly-shield-inheritable.scss (which is compiled to `patternfly-shield-inheritable.css`) and https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/patternfly-shield-noninheritable.scss (which is compiled to `patternfly-shield-noninheritable.css`)

The contents of [_shield-inheritable.scss](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/_shield-inheritable.scss) and [_shield-noninheritable.scss](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/_shield-noninheritable.scss) are now SCSS mixins called `shield-inheritable` and `shield-noninheritable`, which allow us to include the blocks of code in SCSS conditionals.

This PR sets new styles on buttons necessary with the removal of `background-color: transparent` from all elements that the shield styles provided previously. No further updates should be needed to consume these style updates, and the visuals should remain exactly the same as they were before. The location of the styles just changed from the shield to the button component. 

* Link and Plain buttons now define `background-color: transparent` by default and on hover, focus, and active states.
* The control button now sets a white background and default text color for its normal, hover, focus, and active states.

As part of these button updates, the `:active` CSS selectors in the button component's stylesheet were moved after `:focus`, so that if the `:focus` and `:active` pseudo selectors declare styles on the same CSS properties for an element, the `:active` styles will now be visible when the element is `:active`. No changes are needed to consume this change, however any `:active` styles that may have been overridden by the `:focus` styles coming later in the stylesheet may now be visible.

## fix(sass-utilities): made bs-variables optional include [(#2871)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2871)
Removes `sass-utilities/bs-variables.scss` from `sass-utilities/_all.scss`, so it is no longer part of building the standard patternfly CSS. If you still need to import this file, you can import it manually.

## fix(table-td-wrapping): added to overflow-wrap [(#2868)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2868)
* This change addresses aggressive table cell text wrapping. Changes `td { word-break: break-word; }` to `tr > * { overflow-wrap: break-word; }`. No changes are necessary to consume this update.

## fix(empty-state): center content, fix vars, adjust secondary margin [(#2866)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2866)
* Introduces a new element `.pf-c-empty-state__content` that wraps the contents of the empty state content. The `max-width` used for the size variations applies to `.pf-c-empty-state__content` instead of `.pf-c-empty-state`, and `.pf-c-empty-state__content` is centered horizontally and vertically in its parent, reducing the need for using a `.pf-l-bullseye` layout to center empty state content. The bullseye layout can be removed from the empty state if it is being used to center the empty state horizontally, though there is likely no harm in leaving it.
  * Adds `--pf-c-empty-state__content--MaxWidth` that is overridden with `.pf-m-sm` and `.pf-m-lg` via `--pf-c-empty-state--m-sm__content--MaxWidth` and `--pf-c-empty-state--m-lg__content--MaxWidth`
  * Adds a `.pf-m-full-height` variation to `.pf-c-empty-state` for use when the empty state component should be centered vertically in a container, and the empty state does not already consume the height of its container.
* Adjusts the left/right spacing on buttons in the secondary actions container so that instead of using a `margin-right` to space the buttons, we use a `margin-left` and `margin-right`, which allows us to get rid of the negative right margin on the secondary actions container. All direct children of the secondary actions container are now styled instead of just `.pf-c-button` elements.
  * Removes `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--MarginRight`. This was just to offset the right margin on buttons in the `__secondary` container and is no longer necessary. Any references to this variable should be removed as it is no longer used.
  * Renames `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary__c-button--MarginRight` to `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--child--MarginRight` and `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary__c-button--MarginBottom` to `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--child--MarginBottom`. Any references you may have to these vars need to be updated to the new names.
  * Adds `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--child--MarginLeft`. The margin between secondary actions is now calculated from `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--child--MarginLeft` and `--pf-c-empty-state__secondary--child--MarginRight` between adjacent buttons.
* Renames the following variables. Any references to the old vars will need to be updated to use the new vars.
  * Renames `--pf-c-empty-state--c-button--MarginTop` to `--pf-c-empty-state__primary--MarginTop`
  * Renames `--pf-c-empty-state--c-button__secondary--MarginTop` to `--pf-c-empty-state__primary--secondary--MarginTop`

## fix(table): replaced expanded content box shadow with border [(#2861)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2861)
*  The variable `--pf-c-table__expandable-row--m-expanded--BoxShadow` has been removed. All instances of this should be deleted from the application.
* Expanded content box shadow replaced with border. This is a visual change only. No further action is needed to consume this change.

  * `--pf-c-wizard--m-in-page__nav--lg--BoxShadow`
  * `--pf-c-wizard--m-in-page__nav--lg--BorderRightWidth`
  * `--pf-c-wizard--m-in-page__nav--lg--BorderRightColor`

## fix(modal): updated box shadow size [(#2859)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2859)
* changes box shadow from lg to xl. This is a visual breaking change only. No further action required to consume this change.

## fix(clipboard-copy): replaced expandable box-shadow with border [(#2856)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2856)
This change replaces the expandable content's box-shadow with a border and removes the transparent border around the expandable content box. This is a visual change only. No further updates are needed to consume this change.

Also as part of this update we removed the following variables. Any reference to them should be removed as they are no longer used.
* removes `--pf-c-clipboard-copy__expandable-content--BorderWidth`
* removes `--pf-c-clipboard-copy__expandable-content--BoxShadow`

## fix(tooltip): added box shadow [(#2855)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2855)

## fix(box-shadow): update global shadows, add xl, update shadow utility [(#2854)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2854)
* The global box-shadow variables were updated with slight modifications. This is a visual change only. No further updates are needed to consume this change.

## fix(page): reduce space between tertiary nav, breadcrumbs, main section [(#2837)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2837)
The following variables were removed. Any reference to them should be removed as they are no longer used.
* removes `--pf-c-page__main-nav--PaddingBottom`
* removes `--pf-c-page__main-breadcrumb--md--PaddingTop`
* removes `--pf-c-page__main-nav--main-breadcrumb--PaddingTop`


Also reduced the space between the breadcrumb section and page section that is below it to `var(--pf-global--spacer--md)`. This is a visual change only. No other updates are required to consume this change.

## fix(colors): update cyan-600 cyan-700 blue-600 and blue-700 [(#2832)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2832)
The following are visual changes only. No further action is required to consume these changes.

The following variable has changed. Any reference to it should be changed as well.
1. Changes `--pf-c-table--FontWeight` to `--pf-c-table-cell--FontWeight`

## fix(button): add modifiers to position icon in button [(#2828)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2828)
* Adds the modifiers `pf-m-start` and `pf-m-end` to position `pf-c-button__icon` in the button component depending on whether it comes before or after text. We made this change so that we could safely position the icon before or after text, without needing to introduce a new class that wraps the text. **If you are using a button with an icon, you will need to use one of these modifiers to style the icon .**

Removes the following variables. Any references to them will need to be removed as they are no longer used in PatternFly.
*  `  --pf-c-button__icon--MarginRight`
* `--pf-c-button__text--icon--MarginLeft`.

Removes the following class. Any references to it will need to be removed as it is no longer used in PatternFly.
*  `.pf-c-button__text`

## fix(select/contextselector): update name for menu search [(#2826)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2826)
Renames the following variables. Any references to the old vars will need to be updated to use the new vars.

* changes `--pf-c-select__menu-input--PaddingTop` to `--pf-c-select__menu-search--PaddingTop`
* changes `--pf-c-select__menu-input--PaddingRight` to `--pf-c-select__menu-search--PaddingRight`
* changes `--pf-c-select__menu-input--PaddingBottom` to `--pf-c-select__menu-search--PaddingBottom`
* changes `--pf-c-select__menu-input--PaddingLeft` to `--pf-c-select__menu-search--PaddingLeft`

## fix(page-header-tools-margin): removed margin-top/bottom [(#2821)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2821)
The following variables were removed. Any reference to them should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly.
1. `--pf-c-page__header-tools--MarginTop: var(--pf-global--spacer--sm);`
2. `--pf-c-page__header-tools--MarginBottom: var(--pf-global--spacer--sm);`

## fix(color): updated black global and background global/component vars [(#2818)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2818)
* Removes `$pf-global--BackgroundColor--150` and `$pf-global--BackgroundColor--300`, and the associated CSS variables `--pf-global--BackgroundColor--150` and `--pf-global--BackgroundColor--300`
  * Updated all components that use `$pf-global--BackgroundColor--150` or `$pf-global--BackgroundColor--300` to use  `$pf-global--BackgroundColor--200` instead.
  * Any references to the variables that were removed should be reviewed, and can be updated to use `--pf-global--BackgroundColor--200`/`$pf-global--BackgroundColor--200` instead. However you might want to consult your visual designer first. 

The values for these global color variables has changed. These are visual changes only. No further updates are needed to consume these changes.

* `$pf-color-black-200` changes from `#ededed ` to `#f0f0f0`
* `$pf-color-black-600` changes from `#737679` to `#6a6e73`
* `$pf-global--BackgroundColor--200` changes to `$pf-color-black-200 `

## fix(color): updated success-100, success-200, green-500 global vars [(#2817)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2817)

* `$pf-color-green-500` changes from `#467f40` to `#3e8635`
* `$pf-global--success-color--100` changes from `$pf-color-light-green-400` to `$pf-color-green-500`
* `$pf-global--success-color--200` changes from `$pf-color-light-green-600` to `$pf-color-green-700`

## fix(components): change components to be mobile first [(#2816)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2816)
This PR addresses components using `max-width`, and coverts them to use `min-width `in an effort to be “mobile-first”. One component that cannot satisfy this is the table. At the mobile viewport, native/default properties are modified to achieve a grid based layout. To overwrite these changes would require adding back native properties to the table. For that reason, the table will remain the exception to a “mobile-first” approach.

The components that are now mobile-first are: background image, data list, data toolbar, form, login, page, toolbar, and wizard.

Changes the following variable names. The original variable should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly.

* `--pf-c-data-list__item-content--PaddingBottom` changes to `--pf-c-data-list__item-content--md--PaddingBottom`
* `--pf-c-data-list__item-action--not-last-child--lg--MarginBottom` changes to `--pf-c-data-list__item-action--not-last-child--MarginBottom`
* `--pf-c-data-list__expandable-content--md--MaxHeight` changes to `--pf-c-data-list__expandable-content--MaxHeight`
* `--pf-c-data-list__item-content--PaddingBottom` changes to `--pf-c-data-list__item-content--md--PaddingBottom`
* `--pf-c-login__header--sm--PaddingLeft` changes to `--pf-c-login__header--PaddingLeft`
* `--pf-c-login__header--sm--PaddingRight` changes to `--pf-c-login__header--PaddingRight`
* `--pf-c-login__main--xl--MarginBottom` changes to `--pf-c-login__main--MarginBottom`
* `--pf-c-login__footer--sm--PaddingLeft` changes to `--pf-c-login__footer--PaddingLeft`
* `--pf-c-login__footer--sm--PaddingRight` changes to `--pf-c-login__footer--PaddingRight`

Removes the following variables. Any references to them will need to be removed as they are no longer used in PatternFly.

* Removes `--pf-c-page__main-section--m-no-padding-mobile--md--PaddingTop`
* Removes `--pf-c-page__main-section--m-no-padding-mobile--md--PaddingRight`
* Removes `--pf-c-page__main-section--m-no-padding-mobile--md--PaddingBottom`
* Removes `--pf-c-page__main-section--m-no-padding-mobile--md--PaddingLeft`

Update your application if it uses `.pf-m-no-padding-mobile`. This PR removes that class from PatternFly. Instead we introduce the following variables:

* Introduces `.pf-m-no-padding{-on-[breakpoint]}` which removes padding from the main page section at an optional breakpoint.
* Introduces `.pf-m-padding{-on-[breakpoint]}` which modifies the main page section to add padding back in at a specified breakpoint. Should be used with pf-m-no-padding.

Changes the value of the global gutter. If you were using the global-gutter you may need to now use `global--gutter--md`

* `$pf-global--gutter:` now has the value  `$pf-global--spacer--md`
* `$pf-global--gutter--md` now has the value `$pf-global--spacer--lg`

## fix(radio, check): fixed radio left margin overflow, error in selector [(#2799)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2799)
Adds a `1px` left margin to a radio component's input element when it comes before the label. This is a visual change only and no further updates are needed to consume this change.

## fix(datalist): update compact font-size [(#2777)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2777)
* Changes compact data-list font-size to `--pf-global--FontSize--sm`. This is a visual change only. No further updates are needed to consume this change.

## fix(table): update compact spacing [(#2775)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2775)
The following changes are visual changes only. No updates are needed in an application to consume these changes.

* Changed compact table's header spacing from `--pf-global--spacer--md` top and bottom padding to `calc(var(--pf-global--spacer--sm) + var(--pf-global--spacer--xs))` top padding and `var(--pf-global--spacer--sm)` bottom padding.
* Changed compact table's responsive/grid spacers. All values changed from the default table's responsive spacers:
  * `<tr>` top/bottom padding changed to `var(--pf-global--spacer--sm)`
  * `<td>` top/bottom padding changed to `var(--pf-global--spacer--xs)`

## fix(form): refactored label/control sections, added label help [(#2766)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2766)
This PR adds 2 new elements used for the overall form layout. These elements are the main sections that make up a `.pf-c-form__group`.
* `.pf-c-form__group-label` - defines the label section of the form. Anything that is above the form control element(s) in a stacked form, and to the left of form control element(s) in a horizontal form. Primarily this will hold the `.pf-c-form__label`. Also as a change introduced in this PR, it will hold the field level help element `.pf-c-form__label-help`.
  * All `.pf-c-label` and any other elements that should be grouped with the label should now be wrapped in `.pf-c-form__group-label`
* `.pf-c-form__group-control` - defines the control section of the form. This is where form control elements are placed. It will hold the form elements and form element helper text.
  * All form control elements (`.pf-c-form-control`, `.pf-c-check`, `.pf-c-radio`, etc ) should be wrapped in a single `.pf-c-form__group-control` element per form group.

`.pf-m-border` and `.pf-c-form__section` have been removed from the documentation as we currently do not have styles for those. Any reference to those should be removed as patternfly does not have any styles for them.

The following modifiers have moved from one element to another. Any reference to them should be moved from the old element to the new element
* `.pf-m-no-padding-top` has moved from `.pf-c-form__label` to `.pf-c-form__group-label`
* `.pf-m-inline` has been moved from `.pf-c-form__group` to `.pf-c-form__group-control`

The following variables have been removed. Any reference to them should be removed as they are no longer used in patternfly:
* `--pf-c-form__label--Color`
* `--pf-c-form__label--FontWeight`
* `--pf-c-form__group--MarginLeft`
* `--pf-c-form--m-horizontal--md__group--GridTemplateColumns`
  * This was used to define the label and form control column widths in horizontal forms. You can now modify the label column width via `--pf-c-form--m-horizontal__group-label--md--GridColumnWidth` and the form control column width via `--pf-c-form--m-horizontal__group-label--md--GridColumnWidth`

The following variables have been renamed. Any reference to the old variable should be updated to use the new variable:
* `--pf-c-form--m-inline--MarginRight` has changed to `--pf-c-form__group-control--m-inline--child--MarginRight`
* `--pf-c-form--m-error--Color` has changed to `--pf-c-form__helper-text--m-error--Color`
* `--pf-c-form--m-success--Color` has changed to `--pf-c-form__helper-text--m-success--Color`

Some of the general CSS structure has also changed, so please reference the [file changeset](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2766/files) or the [form component stylesheet](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/blob/v4/src/patternfly/components/Form/form.scss) to see the new structure.

## fix(form-control): enabled success/invalid states for readonly controls [(#2753)](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly/pull/2753)
Instead of styling the shorthand `background` to add the status icon for the success and invalid states, we're now styling the individual background properties that need to change. As result, the `background` property declarations that were used to add the status icons and their associated variables have been removed.

This PR removes the following variables. Developers should remove any reference to them in their code as they are no longer used.
*  `--pf-c-form-control--success--check--Background`
*  `--pf-c-form-control--success--Background`
*  `--pf-c-form-control__select--arrow--Background`
*  `--pf-c-form-control__select--Background`
*  `--pf-c-form-control__select--invalid--Background`
*  `--pf-c-form-control__select--success--Background`
